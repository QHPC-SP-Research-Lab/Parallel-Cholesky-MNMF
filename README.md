# ComplexNMF
The Multichannel NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) is a method used for audio source separation which involves decomposing a matrix of mixed audio signals into a product of matrices that represent the individual sources.

This driver is designed to be called from numerical computing environments such as Matlab or Octave and is capable of running on multi-core CPUs and GPUs. It uses parallel and high performance techniques and compute the multiplicative update rules using the Cholesky decomposition and triangular equation systems to reduce the computational cost.

It has been evaluated in different scenarios and has shown promising results in terms of execution times on both CPUs and GPUs.
